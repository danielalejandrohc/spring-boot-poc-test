JSON Patch
JSON Patch is part of RFC 6902. It is a standard designed to allow performing
operations on JSON documents. JSON Patch can work with the HTTP PATCH
method. It is useful to provide partial updates to JSON documents. The media type
"application/json-patch+json" is used to identify such patch documents.
It takes the following members:
• op: This identifies the operation to be performed on the document.
The acceptable values are "add", "replace", "move", "remove",
"copy", or "test". Any other value is an error.
• path: This is the JSON pointer that represents the location in the
JSON document.
• value: This denotes the value to be replaced in the JSON document.
The move operation takes a "from" member, which identifies the location in the
target document to move the value from.
Here is an example of a JSON Patch document sent in a HTTP PATCH request:
PATCH /coffee/orders/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.foo.com
Content-Length: 100
Content-Type: application/json-patch
[
 {"op":"replace", "path": "/status", "value": "COMPLETED"}
]

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
The preceding request shows how JSON Patch can be used to replace the status of
a coffee order identified by resource coffee/orders/1234 .The operation, that is,
"op" in the preceding snippet, is "replace", which sets the value "COMPLETED" to
the status object in the JSON representation.
The JSON Patch is very useful for single-page applications, real-time collaboration,
offline data changes, and can also be used in applications that need to make small
updates in large documents. For more details, check http://jsonpatchjs.com/,
